## Summary
See the result of specified number of dice rolls, using dice of any size.

## Instructions
When prompted, type in the desired number of side on each die.

You will then be prompted to enter the number of dice to roll.
> Note: If the numbers are large then a confirmation will be requested. Type "yes" and hit enter to continue.

The program should then iterate through each roll up to the number of rolls selected, inclusive.
> Tip: Rolling the traditional six-sided dice (d6) will output an ASCII image of the roll results as well. Please note that the ASCII image may be distorted by small window sizes.
> Note: More options will be added soon, such as for calculating average/mean rolls and more.
